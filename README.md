## What is Kanal
Kanal is a Rust library to help programmers design effective programs in CSP model via providing featureful multi-producer multi-consumer channels.
This library focuses on bringing both sync and async API together to unify message passing between sync and async parts of Rust code in a performant manner.

**Performance is the main goal of Kanal.**

### Benchmark Results
Results are normalized based on kanal sync results, so 60x means the test for that framework takes 60 times slower than kanal.
